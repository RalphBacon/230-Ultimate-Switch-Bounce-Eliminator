### One sketch but needs changes for Arduino
#### The sketch was written on the PlatformIO IDE for an ESP32 but will also work in the Arduino IDE for an Arduino UNO (or similar).
Read the comments for the changes you need to make.  
Also, rename it to end with .ino (not .cpp) and put it into a folder of the same name in your Arduino Sketches folder.
