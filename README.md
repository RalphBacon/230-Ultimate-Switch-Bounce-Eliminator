### It's time to try a final, alternative approach to the ubiquitous switch bounce problem.

#### To see whether there are any PCBs going spare have a look at the first pinned comment under this video!

So we now have a simple, one-chip hardware solution that guarantees no switch bounce from any switch, not just a rotary encoder. Just feed the output from here into the microcontroller of your choice and never worry about switch bounce again!
